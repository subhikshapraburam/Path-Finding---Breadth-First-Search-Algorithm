# Path-Finding---Breadth-First-Search-Algorithm
Python Path Finding Tutorial - Breadth First Search Algorithm

One of the common applications of breadth first search is to perform path finding. Typically this is done in a 2D maze. The code below implements the breadth first search algorithm to traverse and find the shortest path out of a maze.
I have also uploaded my presentaion slides, for better understanding of this code and the working behind it you can have a look at this presentation.
